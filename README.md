# Bus Timetable Project spec

Patrons at a bus station want to know when their buses are due to depart. As they wait at their terminal, they will see a display with a countdown by minute for when their bus is due to depart the station. We would like you to implement a bus timetable display to show the next two buses due to depart the terminus.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The display should show a clock, so people know what time it is.
- The display should show the next two buses due to leave the station.
- The display should show a minute-by-minute update on when the buses are due to depart.
- The display should indicate when no buses are due to depart in the next 15 minutes.
- Every minute on the timetable should be represented in real-time seconds (i.e. 1 hour = 60 seconds)
- The application should have appropriate unit tests.
- All buses leaving the station should be represented.
- The application must be built using front end JavaScript technologies (vanilla ES6/React/Node/Vue etc).

## Available Scripts
